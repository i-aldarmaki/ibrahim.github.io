### About:
I am currently completing my mandatory national service. I was selected for the Al Nokhba (Arabic: "النخبة", English: "The Elite") Program to do research at Khalifa University as part of my service. Currently, I am working in Research and Developement (R&D) at the intersection between signal processing and machine learning for healthcare applications using wireless sensing.

I am broadly interested in signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning. My previous work was mainly in signal, audio, and speech processing, neural architectures, and time-series analysis. I enjoy exploring multidisciplinary problems, such as a recent work in portfolio optimization.

I was recently a researcher at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), where I worked with 
[Prof. Thamar Solorio](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/thamar-solorio/), 
[Prof. Bhiksha Raj](https://cmu-mlsp.github.io/team/bhiksha_raj), and 
[Dr. Hanan Aldarmaki](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/hanan-al-darmaki/)
. I received my bachelors in Electronics and Electrical Engineering (EEE) at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked on my thesis at the 
[Insitute for Data, Imaging, and Communications (IDCOM)](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/idcom). 
I previously worked in planetary and atmospheric physics at [Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC)](https://www.mbrsc.ae/) as a space scientists within the [Emirates Mars Mission](https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/) science team.
