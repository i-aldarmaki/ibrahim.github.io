### About:
I am a recent graduate holding a bachelors degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering (EEE). I enjoy learning new things and working on interesting projects. Recently, I started making some of my projects open to the public. 

I am very interested in how (well) we can extract information from data. From a signal processing (and many other things like probability theory etc.)  prospective, I try to understand why these things work. 



### Open-Source Projects:
\- Coming Soon : Audio Equalizer ()

\- Navigating Through The Unknown (Adaptive Filtering + Kalman Filtering)

\- Augmented Reality Box (Computer Vision + Augmented Reality)


### Updates:
