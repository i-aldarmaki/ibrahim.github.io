### About:
I am a researcher at Khalifa University working at the intersection between signal processing and machine learning.

I was recently a researcher at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI). I received my bachelors in Electronics and Electrical Engineering (EEE) at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked at the Insitute for Data, Imaging, and Communications (IDCOM). I previously worked in planetary and atmospheric physics at Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) as a space scientists within the Emirates Mars Mission science team. 

I am broadly interested in signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning. My previous work was mainly in signal, audio, and speech processing, neural architectures, and time-series analysis. I enjoy exploring multidisciplinary problems, such as a recent work in portfolio optimization.
