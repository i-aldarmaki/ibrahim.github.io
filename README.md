### About:
Hi! I am a Research Assistant at Khalifa University. I am currently researching and developing machine learning and signal processing algorithms for real-time, low-latency Wi-Fi sensing applications in healthcare.

I am broadly interested in signal processing, machine learning, and information theory. My previous work was mainly in signal processing, neural networks, and time-series analysis. I also enjoy exploring multidisciplinary problems, such as a recent work in portfolio optimization.

I recently worked as a researcher at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI). During my time at MBZUAI, I worked/collaborated with 
[Prof. Thamar Solorio](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/thamar-solorio/), 
[Prof. Bhiksha Raj](https://cmu-mlsp.github.io/team/bhiksha_raj), and 
[Dr. Hanan Aldarmaki](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/hanan-al-darmaki/)
. Prior to joining MBZUAI, I also worked at several other institutions. For a more detailed description of my background and experience, please refer to my [CV](file/Ibrahim_Resume_2024_April.pdf). (Last updated: December 2024)
