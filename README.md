### About:
I am mainly interested in signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning. I am currently working as a researcher at Khalifa University as part of my National Service. I previously worked at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI). I graduated with a bachelors degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering (EEE), where I did my thesis at the Institute for Imaging, Data, and Communications (IDCOM).I also worked in planetary and atmospheric physics at Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) as a space scientists within the Emirates Mars Mission science team. 

Today, large amounts of data are being generated from everywhere, and I am invested in understanding how we can reliably extract information from these sources. My focus lies in developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms that can process time-series, numerical, and categorical (and more!) data to solve a variety of problems. 


### News:
- [Sep. 2024] Submitted "RelUNet: Relative Channel Fusion U-Net for Multichannel Speech Enhancement" paper for ICASSP 2025.
- [Sep. 2024] Joined Khalifa University as a Researcher.
- [Dec. 2023] Joined Mohammed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) as a Research Assistant.

### Current Research:
I am currently working on these research projects:
* Source Separation & Enhancement, with a focus on speech.
* Language Modeling, Low-Resource Languages, and Code-Mixing.

### Open-Source Projects:
I have recently started sharing some of my projects to the public! So, here is a list of my open-source projects.
* [Navigating Through The Unknown](https://github.com/i-aldarmaki/Navigating-Through-the-Unknown) (Adaptive Filtering + Kalman Filter)
* [C(ube)ARnival](https://github.com/i-aldarmaki/CubeARnival) (Computer Vision + Augmented Reality)
